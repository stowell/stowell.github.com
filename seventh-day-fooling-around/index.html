<p class="name"><em>The Seventh Day</em>, <em>Fooling Around</em></p>
<p>The greatest sin in art is to announce your intentions, either directly before the piece or through overt methods right in the body of thing. Rat Colums and Yu Hua for the most part avoid this deliberate mistake through the time-honored traditions of indecipherable lyrics and writing plainly.</p><p>As always it is incumbent upon you to not bring any molds with you. You might see the words &#39;China&#39; or &#39;satire&#39; in a review of <em><a href="http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/237750/the-seventh-day-by-yu-hua/">The Seventh Day</a></em> and begin remembering editorials or blag posts about a place also called &#39;China&#39; and enter into a mood before you have begun. Do not do this. Why would you listen to me.</p><p>Writing down what happens is often very funny. I laughed from the start of the book though less and less as I got deeper. The premise, that the protagonist does not have a burial plot and must wander in the world he just left, is funny in itself but also serves as a vehicle to share vignettes, meaning that you can laugh at new foibles in every chapter but cannot spend long enough with any single person-character-entity to feel her-his tragedy in your gut. It is more a thing that happened to someone else. This book will not alter you. That&#39;s okay; I enjoyed it more than most novels (especially the ones that attempt to elicit sympathy), but will probably not read it again for some time, until I have almost completely forgotten it and can be surprised again.</p><p><em><a href="http://blackesteverblack.bigcartel.com/product/rat-columns-i-fooling-around-e-p-i-blackest043-12">Fooling Around</a></em> also consists entirely of vignettes held together by a hope that the guitars will finally break free (they do not, the point of all things is suspended anticipation, a state that most people cannot achieve for themselves let alone strangers). Pick your favorite band that resembles Yo La Tengo, either prior to Yo La Tengo&#39;s formation or directly after, and you will find a way to relate that band to Rat Columns. Really the only way the &#39;band&#39; can stand on its own is to do what it has done: release an EP once a year maybe and not really worry about anything. Upon at least the third listen today and the eighth this week it strikes me that &#39;Strays&#39; is the key track, being the most quiet and subtle, the most chill really. &#39;Should I Leave You Alone?&#39; gave me a quick jolt of adrenaline, I was afraid that my phone had broken in a specific way that forced it to play The Microphones no matter what else in this large-but-still-expanding-needlessly universe you wanted to hear.</p>
