<p>Had the pleasure last night of watching a Celtics team we don&#39;t know at all. It&#39;s been a while. The Garden has metal detectors now. I can guess when those went in but won&#39;t. When we reached our deep balcony seats there was someone in them. In the end six people stood up to make room for the two of us. &#39;Do we even have real seats?&#39; &#39;Just wanted to all be able to sit together.&#39; Presumably they found their way.</p><p>The game itself was sloppy at times and wide ranging, flipping between fast breaks and offensive sets that ended in junk threes or seventeen-footers. It was great. One of the reasons I prefer college basketball to the NBA is that anything can happen. People cry all the time. The routine is not guaranteed. No one cried that I saw last night but you couldn&#39;t really count on a layup or that terrible-looking shot not falling.</p><p>We probably spent more time watching people &#39;dance&#39; on the jumbotron than watching live basketball. The number of times that the camera focused on people sucked into their phones was telling but not surprising.</p><p>Surrounding conversation was a solid C+. No grand epistemological mistakes or memorable sentences. A brief enumeration of all the &#39;professional&#39; New England sports teams that one woman has not seen in person. You can buy sushi at Gillette Stadium. Who knew. Pairs of men and women talking about the &#39;opposite&#39; gender in hushed tones. Someone wondering again and again if they would still be in the stadium when the Powerball winners were announced.</p><p>It&#39;s refreshing not to know a single player. You expect nothing and are open to more. Does he have any business fading away on the baseline? This wide open three with twelve on the shot clock, is it a good idea? Who cares just play. Certainly good marketing for forgetting most everything you know about your co-workers every six months.</p><p>One of the joys of balcony seats is thinking two passes ahead. Without actually being able to see where the passing lanes are everything becomes simple, reduced, just connect the dots. It&#39;s satisfying when you guess right (there&#39;s probably some terrible mobile game waiting to be invented where you swipe the path the ball will take and earn &#39;points&#39; when you&#39;re correct) and fun to be surprised. The one play I can actually remember in some vividness is the Celtics point guard flipping the ball underhand through two Pacers midway down the lane for a layup. That pass simply did not exist from where we sat and probably only existed in three dimensions for some smallish number of milliseconds.</p>
