<p class="name">Green Sky Accident</p>
<p><a href="http://greenskyaccident.com/">Green Sky Accident</a>&#39;s <em><a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1p713qaBV4qtcw0EtO7sM7">Fever Dreams</a></em> is easily my favorite album of 2015. It has to be the best unheard album of the year. Green Sky Accident lives in Bergen and doesn&#39;t get out of Norway much (at least to play music), so it&#39;s not surprising that this album hasn&#39;t topped any charts. But it&#39;s what I&#39;ve listened to most this year and I&#39;m not wrong in loving it.</p><p>After ten months of trying to distill what about this particular rock album puts it ahead of all rock albums I&#39;ve got nothing. It&#39;s unabashedly guitar-driven. There&#39;s more than one decent singer. It&#39;s not afraid of sounding epic. It&#39;s not afraid of sounding like the kind of thing that would play during a montage on a network television drama (do these things still exist).</p><p>So I give up, and I give up in the only way I know how, which is with a hyperlink and an underhanded thank you to <a href="https://twitter.com/eliotvb">Eliot Van Buskirk</a> for validating a love that has no justification. Here&#39;s <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/123989663/playlist/297EhRBlwCzkzC6HKQYE6v">what we hear when we listen to Green Sky Accident</a>.</p>
