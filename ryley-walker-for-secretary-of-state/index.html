<p class="name">Ryley Walker for Secretary of State</p>
<p>In tumultuous times you need someone who somewhat resembles your image of yourself but far cooler to whom you can attach your aspirations, what you would be without any of the constraints you in fact have chosen.</p><p>Given the current fluidity of the notions of &#39;power&#39; and &#39;authority&#39;, why not appoint Ryley Walker as the Secretary of State? The man tours more days than you get out of bed. People in lots of different countries love him. There&#39;s no real downside.</p><p>Since it&#39;d be kind of a lamedick move to get him the job without asking him first or giving the lay population insight into his foreign policy thinking, I sat down with his Twitter account and asked some questions.</p><p><strong>First of all, let me just say, I love <em>Primrose Green</em>.</strong>
Thank you that&#39;s not a question, but thank you. I recorded two more records last week.</p><p><strong>That&#39;s super exciting.</strong>
Yeah I&#39;m shitting my pants.</p><p><strong>Me too. What&#39;s the one big foreign policy problem you&#39;d like to solve?</strong>
Senior citizens in the Netherlands dress like grime artists from the UK circa 2002.</p><p><strong>That&#39;s a problem?</strong>
I love it.</p><p><strong>But what about Syria? Or Russia? Or the South China Sea?</strong>
You sound like Hillary Clinton.</p><p><strong>I don&#39;t sound like Hillary Clinton.</strong>
I mean, Hillary Clinton talks to her friends who are currently on acid about her dog that just died.</p><p><strong>Some dogs are gonna die when you&#39;re Secretary of State, you know that right? Let&#39;s try something else. What&#39;s the biggest opportunity you see?</strong>
I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m past the age of discovering myself and keeping journals on tour. I just like to eat fried shit and jam. This year I gave Swedish kids American money to set on fire and then we hugged. So probably more of that.</p><p><strong>Anything else?</strong>
Yeah. Airplanes should only show baseball movies and creepy documentaries from the country they are based in.</p><p><strong>What would that do?</strong>
No idea. I shot gunned a beer in 21 countries last year. I&#39;m an idiot.</p><p><strong>I can&#39;t . . .</strong>
And the American flag should just be a pic of a boss metal zone pedal and two middle fingers.</p><p><strong>I can see that having real impact. So you tour all the time. What&#39;s your secret?</strong>
Listening to the Lemonheads.</p><p><strong>Really?</strong>
No, I&#39;m messing with you. Going to Chinese buffets alone. Smoking a lot. Eating huevos rancheros.</p><p><strong>You&#39;re probably going to die.</strong>
Drinking mint leaf water too. That actually is the secret.</p><p><strong>Not to sound like Hillary again, but I&#39;m pretty sure that on this job you&#39;ll have to deal with people who don&#39;t like you or America. Are you up to it?</strong>
Hell yeah. Like right before I got on the plane yesterday I spotted a dude having a full-on meltdown at Fuddruckers DCA. I could watch that shit all day.</p><p><strong>But could you change their minds?</strong>
One time I got the whole lunch room in middle to school to sing &#39;We Will Rock You&#39; with the boom boom clap and everything.</p><p><strong>Impressive.</strong>
Best day of life.</p><p><strong>Is there anything else?</strong>
What if instead of Bloody Marys on Sundays people just threw bricks through a Papa Johns window?</p><p><strong>Okay.</strong>
Then I may actually do brunch.</p><p><strong>So . . .</strong>
New Kanye West album is great I give it an A++++.</p><p><strong>Right. So what are you going to be for Halloween?</strong>
The guy who smokes cigs at Little League games in the bleachers.</p><p><strong>You wouldn&#39;t need . . .</strong>
A dad who gets mad <em>Batman Forever</em> is all out of stock at Blockbuster.</p><p><strong>That could be . . .</strong>
Nam vet smoking straight skunk weed in the wicker chairs outside of Cracker Barrel.</p><p><strong>. . .</strong>
A radio station DJ who introduces John Cougar Mellencamp at a ribfest in the suburbs. Bernie Sanders selling ecstasy out of his car while playing Gang Starr. Your co-worker at Papa Johns named Cody who bums all your cigs and always gets in trouble for wearing jeans and leaving the oven open.</p><p><strong>Thank you. America will be lucky to . . .</strong>
The dude in your dorm who plays Ween&#39;s <em>The Mollusk</em> while you get high circa 1999. And the manager of Panera bread.</p><p><strong>1999 was really some great times. We hope you bring it back.</strong></p>
