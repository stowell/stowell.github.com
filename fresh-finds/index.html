<p id="name">Fresh Finds</p>
<p>The first time you hear a new favorite song, it reaches out of the background noise and the passing of seconds and picks you up by your too-thin t-shirt to keep you from moving or listening to anything else.</p><p>If you&#39;re like me you start chasing that feeling, knowing that you can&#39;t force it but maybe you can put yourself in the right place often enough that it&#39;ll find you. It&#39;s hard to set out for serendipity. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/3rgsDhGHZxZ9sB9DQWQfuf">Fresh Finds</a>, a playlist that <a href="https://twitter.com/kurtjx">Kurt</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/zthangz">Athena</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonsteinbach">Jason</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bwhitman">Brian</a>, some computers, and I publish on Wednesdays, is the closest I&#39;ve come to hand-delivery of good, sometimes great, new music.</p><p>We started publishing the playlist regularly last November. Kurt said something like &#39;we haven&#39;t looked at what our cool users are listening to.&#39; (He probably didn&#39;t use the word &#39;cool&#39;). The first attempt yielded every huge pop song released in the last eighteen years. By copying a deceptively simple formula from <a href="https://twitter.com/glenn_mcdonald">Glenn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/smershon">Stu</a>, we moved from the hits to the decidedly hip. Since then it&#39;s been a matter of listening to a lot of obscure music, tightening our filters, philosophizing, and tweeting. I&#39;m particularly proud of all the small, boring tweaks we made along the way to give this playlist its distinct feel.</p><p>Hearing a grab-bag of songs most every day for eight months has changed the way I listen. I&#39;m much more excited to skip from single to single, but when I need refuge from hearing anything unfamiliar I will happily loop an album for days on end. Two finds in particular saved me from the blank ocean of pop and EDM: <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/1p713qaBV4qtcw0EtO7sM7">Green Sky Accident&#39;s <em>Fever Dreams</em></a> (imagine Blink-182, Galaxie 500, and Band of Horses holed up in western Norway for a winter to record an album) and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/6hcXrIt3lGleAmg2cqtMQj">Darts&#39; <em>Below Empty &amp; Westward Bound</em></a> (imagine early Modest Mouse reincarnated as wistful Australian rockers). My guilty pleasure of the year is <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6DJLhMrXhyW0XJXxFDIkUT">Goodbye Tomorrow</a>, who is either the realest thing to come out of Chicago or the product of a marketing machine targeted at formerly/slightly disaffected youth who now have real jobs that pay them real salaries to spend on their real nostalgia.</p><p>Having watched Fresh Finds in action for the better part of a year, I worry less often about all good, new music drying up, but the fear does strike on random nights and it&#39;s a good fear to have, that maybe people will stop recording in their parent&#39;s basements.</p>
