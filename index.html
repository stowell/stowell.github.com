Make all the art in the first twenty years, right away, before someone grows up wanting to be what you have become, never thinks a thought wholly his own.

A process spins up as many threads as the machine has cores, pinning each thread to a different core. One thread communicates with the outside world. Hell, that same thread makes all system calls. The other threads execute instructions. The game is to miss L1 cache and the instruction cache as infrequently as possible. No need for schedulers or memory allocation or garbage collection. The process owns the machine.
&sect; Three months later, I'm still listening to <em>One Kiss Ends It All</em> once a day.
&sect; Do you think Bolívar would understand these streets? Bitter coffee in the slowing heart of summer. A dawn that turns the corner behind you and walks right past you without saying hello. How can you walk in the same shapes? How can you sleep in a bed? How can it be two thousand miles from the sea to the mountains?

For small projects that start at odd hours and have one author (you), you just want to know you won't lose anything. <a href="http://drafin.com">Draft</a> solves this problem by auto-saving every keystroke but requiring users to mark drafts. Instead of thousands of revisions to sift through, I usually have a handful for any document. I haven't seen the equivalent for code yet.
&sect; Discounting the lack of modern weapons (and drones), <em>Hadji Murat</em> could have been written today.
&sect; <em>Madame Secretary</em> ends with the last-ditch effort for an Israeli-Palestinian agreement. It's been over ten years since Albright wrote these memoirs, and little has changed. I wonder if the Middle East will look strikingly the same fifty years from now.
&sect; If you wanted everyone in the world to know you exist for a few hours, maybe a few days, what would you do?
&sect; <em>You Have Already Gone to the Other World</em> from A Hawk and a Hacksaw: yes, it is a soundtrack, a pile of self-contained songs, but it is raucous and always aware of death.
&sect; Doubt everything just a little bit.
&sect; You so easily forget the crimes of the people with whom you identify. We try to keep a ledger of right and wrong when we should just record every thing.
&sect; We have all these machines, yet still compile programs in a series of processes on a single machine. We have all these machines, yet don't run many simulations of the same program. We have all these fast disks, yet we don't record information about programs across executions. We spend most of our time connected to the web (I'm writing this in a browser), yet edit and compile code using programs we've installed onto our machines.

In <em>The Great Game</em>, Hopkirk depicts British public opinion of
Russia veering from fear to anger to boredom, independent of the distance between
Russian armies and India. He doesn't draw any parallels to today, but opinion can move
much more quickly. Remember that the next time the temperature rises. He also doesn't
answer the question: was it all worth it?
&sect; If you can picture a machine doing your job, build that machine.
