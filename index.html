Immutability is a great gift.
<!-- 10/2013 -->
&sect; Knew what would happen to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna_Karenina"><em>Anna Karenina</em></a>.
Read to find out how. Laughed twice if at all. Cried when she sneaks into Karenin's house to hold her son (pretended not to, to spare the people sitting next to me on the plane). Cannot remember reading anything that tragic without also being biting or foreordained.
<!-- 08/2013 -->
&sect; The first half of <em>Homage to Catalonia</em>: funniest book I've read in a long time. No one can shoot straight. The trains never leave on time, only an hour early or two hours late.
&sect; Memory allocation and reclamation are the dark matter of performance.
&sect; Make all the art in the first twenty years, right away, before someone grows up wanting to be what you have become, never thinks a thought wholly his own.
<!-- 07/2013 -->
&sect; Spin up as many threads as the machine has cores. Pin each thread to a core. One thread communicates with the outside world. Hell, that thread makes all system calls. The other threads execute instructions. The game is to miss L1 cache and the instruction cache as infrequently as possible. No need for schedulers or memory allocation or garbage collection. The process owns the machine.
&sect; Three months later, still listening to <em>One Kiss Ends It All</em> once a day.
&sect; Would Bolívar understand these streets? Bitter coffee in the slowing heart of summer. A dawn that turns the corner behind you and walks right past you without saying hello. How can you walk in the same shapes? How can you sleep in a bed? How can it be two thousand miles from the sea to the mountains?
<!-- 04/2013 -->
&sect; You just want to know you won't lose anything or get lost in it.
&sect; Discounting the lack of modern weapons (and drones), <em>Hadji Murat</em> could have been written today.
&sect; Will the Middle East look strikingly the same fifty years from now?
&sect; If you wanted everyone in the world to know you exist for a few hours, maybe a few days, what would you do?
&sect; <em>You Have Already Gone to the Other World</em> from A Hawk and a Hacksaw: yes, it is a soundtrack, a pile of self-contained songs, but it is raucous and always aware of death.
&sect; Doubt everything just a little bit.
&sect; You so easily forget the crimes of the people with whom you identify. We try to keep a ledger of right and wrong when we should just record every thing.
&sect; All these machines, yet we still compile programs in a series of processes on a single machine. All these machines, yet we don't run many simulations of the same program. All these fast disks, yet we don't record information about programs across executions. All the time on the web, yet we edit and compile code using programs we've installed onto our machines.
<!-- 03/2013 -->
&sect; In <em>The Great Game</em>, British public opinion of
Russia veers from fear to anger to boredom, independent of the distance between
Russian armies and India. Opinion moves
much more quickly today. Remember that the next time the temperature rises.
&sect; If you can picture a machine doing your job, build that machine.
