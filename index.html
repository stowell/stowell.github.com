<p><em>The Meadowlands</em>, The Wrens &sect; In an alleyway under the offices of insurance companies sits a window that does not open. You sit at it seven hours and thirty minutes a day, nine ay em to five pee em with thirty minutes for lunch in the park across the street, eating Subway sandwiches next to kids who will have to choose between Amherst or Kenyon or the inevitable decline of Western civilization (these are not mutually exclusive and in fact may be mutually inclusive). No one comes to you and everyone walks by. It is okay you translate Márquez and bet on the World Series four years from now. No one takes your money. No one takes your crosswords.</p><p><em>Live</em>, Built to Spill &sect; No one goes down this road. You stop and look at the cows staring stupidly at the trees just past the fence. Maybe they stare smartly or maybe their stares lie orthogonal to any conception of intelligence. Why else would you be a cow. You are younger than you know and can immediately feel sad about these days you know abstractly you will miss.</p><p><em>A Constellation of Vital Phenomena</em>, Anthony Marra &sect; There&#39;s such a thing as a hard land just as sure as you step in luck when you don&#39;t need it and scrape it off a few minutes before you do. Thousands of men and women and their horses do that in the same place over a few thousand years and it&#39;ll stick.</p><p><em>Firestarter IPA</em>, Bonfire Brewing &sect; Guy came to the garage, said he wanted to turn to beer when he died. Sure, looked healthy as a buck, nothing to worry about. Two weeks later his picture&#39;s in the obituaries. Nice guy. Obituaries full of nice guys. Six days later his daughter&#39;s at the garage with a canister. How can I say no. Mix the ashes in thin, malt and hop the ever-living hell out of &#39;em. Charge nine bucks for four tallboys. People&#39;ll drink anything in a can.</p><p><em>Glorious Misadventures</em>, Owen Matthews &sect; Things were not always as Anglo as they are now. You could be speaking Russian or French or an earthy Spanish. You could not be sitting down to the same Mission burrito or riding a dark box of glass and metal from the screen in your bed to the screen surrounded by parking lots. Maybe you would be happier. Maybe the world wouldn&#39;t revolve around you and you could take it easy. Sure. You were born just after the perfectly flexible past into the static, interminable, but mostly invisible present.</p><p><em>Amber Ale</em>, Crazy Mountain Brewing &sect; &#39;Let&#39;s just blast our way through,&#39; the hero said to his sidekick, the smarter, tentative one. It&#39;s worked so many times before it has to transcend luck or the dirty gears of luck, a typewriter turned inside out hitting random letters in all directions.</p><p><em>Lese Majesty</em>, Shabazz Palaces &sect; What city is this where are you. Something going on but behind doors that don&#39;t look like doors. Try to walk in a circle but it gets darker, more humid, the street lights dusky and orange. Are they fighting or dancing or talking on their mobiles maybe they are making a deal and oh man you are wearing khakis. But this isn&#39;t about you they don&#39;t see you even when they turn around.</p><p><em>In the Night of Time</em>, Antonio Muñoz Molina &sect; Holding black and white photographs up to the sunlight sifted through high windows. Standing in the same corners for hours you see him and start to image her as a reflection. Thinking, knowing what they&#39;d rather no one knew, staring until the thirties becomes something that happened, an accident, to see them living normal lives as if that were something they could have done.</p><p><em>Sunburner</em>, United Waters &sect; Cops coming but slowly, halving their distance repeatedly over Icelandic asphalt, the air itself slowing things down to the point where you could deal if you would only try.</p><p><em>Stowaway IPA</em>, Baxter Brewing &sect; A wink, nothing too sweet. You been here this whole time. Yeah and you too just guessing. That&#39;s right. Let&#39;s get after our summers. Look out over this river that doesn&#39;t move.</p><p><em>Family Crimes</em>, The Skygreen Leopards &sect; A grin on his face, white beard, talks about his sadness like it&#39;s the weather, you are at the bar on a golden afternoon in September with a bemused meteorologist, you never suspected.</p><p><em>Mosaics Within Mosaics</em>, Circulatory System &sect; An old friend calls. Been awhile. How many years can&#39;t say. Still up to the same goofy. Different neighborhood. A duplex? An orchard. Someone has to not change. Someone has to have been themselves this whole time.</p><p><em>Lost in the Dream</em>, The War on Drugs &sect; The City rising out of The Plains, growing at 82 miles per hour, a too-warm Friday afternoon in April and a speaker out the window, no one here yet but everyone coming, her looking at you and just knowing she hasn&#39;t ruled you out, if you can just hold that thin strand, you have no reason to feel this way anymore, no one does, but here it is.</p><p><em>Your Face Tomorrow</em>, Javier Marias &sect; Smokes too much, talks too much. You first laugh at the pauses then dominate them, try to flatter, ask questions, play the part written on the card. You don&#39;t get up, it is three in the morning. Four days later you drop one of his lines, surely you earned it, no one else could have gone that deep into the night with him or remembered a single thing he said.</p><p><em>One Kiss Ends It All</em>, Saturday Looks Good to Me &sect; A woman of the untrammeled world, smiling in front of you, full brass behind her, singing about breakup after breakup, smiling, this is funny they are all amusing, a slapstick novella of romantic-logistic trifles.</p><p><em>Bolivar: American Liberator</em>, Marie Arana &sect; Would you understand these streets. Bitter coffee in the slowing heart of summer. A dawn that turns the corner behind you and walks right past you without saying hello. How can you walk in the same shapes. How can you sleep in a bed. How can it be two thousand miles from the sea to any real mountains.</p>
