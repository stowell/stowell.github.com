<p><em>Sunburner</em>, United Waters &sect; Cops coming but too slowly, halving their distance repeatedly over molten asphalt the air itself slowing things down to the point where you could deal if you would only try.</p><p><em>Stowaway IPA</em>, Baxter Brewing &sect; A wink, nothing too sweet. You been here this whole time. Yeah and you too just guessing. That&#39;s right. Let&#39;s waste our summers looking out over this river that doesn&#39;t move.</p><p><em>Family Crimes</em>, The Skygreen Leopards &sect; A grin on his face, white beard, talks about his sadness like it&#39;s the weather, you are at the bar on a golden afternoon in September with a bemused meteorologist, you never suspected.</p><p><em>Mosaics Within Mosaics</em>, Circulatory System &sect; An old friend calls. Been awhile. How many years can&#39;t say. Still up to the same goofy. Different neighborhood. A duplex? An orchard. Someone has to not change. Someone has to have been themselves this whole time.</p><p><em>Lost in the Dream</em>, The War on Drugs &sect; The City rising out of The Plains, growing at 82 miles per hour, a too-warm Friday afternoon in April and a speaker out the window, no one here yet but everyone coming, her looking at you and just knowing she hasn&#39;t ruled you out, if you can just hold that thin strand, you have no reason to feel this way anymore, no one does, but here it is.</p><p><em>Your Face Tomorrow</em>, Javier Marias &sect; Smokes too much, talks too much. You try first to laugh at the pauses then dominate them then flatter, ask questions, play the part written on the card. You don&#39;t get up, it is three in the morning. Four days later you pass off one of his lines as your own, surely you earned it, no one else could have gone that deep into the night with him or remembered a single thing he said.</p><p><em>One Kiss Ends It All</em>, Saturday Looks Good to Me &sect; A woman of the untrammeled world, smiling in front of you, full brass behind her, singing about breakup after breakup, smiling, this is funny they are all amusing, a slapstick novella of romantic-logistic trifles.</p><p><em>Bolivar: American Liberator</em>, Marie Arana &sect; Would you understand these streets. Bitter coffee in the slowing heart of summer. A dawn that turns the corner behind you and walks right past you without saying hello. How can you walk in the same shapes. How can you sleep in a bed. How can it be two thousand miles from the sea to real mountains.</p>
