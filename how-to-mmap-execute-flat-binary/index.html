<p class="name">How to mmap and execute a flat binary on Linux</p>
<p>
Let's say you have some machine code lying around (without any jumps) that you want to run. I don't know why <em>you</em> would want to do that. I found myself wanting to (in order to, say, send machine code across the network and execute it on many nodes) but couldn't find a single-page guide. Here it is.
</p>
<p>
First, let's write a tiny program to execute.
</p>
<pre>
unsigned int justreturn() {
    return 243;
}
</pre>
<p>
We'll compile it and then grab its .text section.
</p>
<pre>
$ clang -O0 -c justreturn.c
$ objcopy --only-section=.text -O binary justreturn.o justreturn.bin
</pre>
<p>
Now we have raw machine code sitting in <code>justreturn.bin</code>. We'll need to open that file, map it into readable and executable memory, then call <code>justreturn()</code>.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;fcntl.h&gt;
#include &lt;sys/mman.h&gt;


typedef unsigned int func();


int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    int fd = open(argv[1], O_RDONLY);
    if (-1 == fd) {
        return 1;
    }
    func* f = mmap(
        0, 4096, PROT_READ | PROT_EXEC, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);
    if (MAP_FAILED == f) {
        return 2;
    }
    unsigned int result = f();
    if (243 == result) {
        return 0;
    } else {
        return 3;
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
Compiling and running this beauty at least exits successfully. If we've screwed anything up we'll most likely segfault.
</p>
<pre>
$ clang -O0 -o mapped mapped.c
$ ./mapped justreturn.bin; echo $?
0
</pre>
<p>
I spent a lot of time on StackOverflow and Eli Bendersky's site. The one piece I was missing for the longest time was passing `--only-section=.text` to `objcopy`. I was in fact copying and attempting to run the ELF header. Like a chump.
