<p class="name">RIP Surfin&#39; Obama, sometime 2013-early 2016</p><p>The end came before the end, watching the afternoon sun thicken, listening to Pudge relive every sensation of 1975. Who does that. You weren&#39;t even there. You&#39;re a bobble head.</p><p>The merch fades first, not long after the victory, certainly not beyond the first responsible decision taken, the first true believer disappointed. Surfin&#39; Obama himself always had a tenuous relationship with Real Obama. Who could know for sure that citizenship doubts didn&#39;t drive sales?  For his part, he steered clear of anyone who said POTUS without giggling like a fourteen year old boy. Most all of DC, really.</p><p>The worst thing about the end was how long it was. The glory days he could count on a balled-up fist. Measuring forty ounces of Bengali Tiger through a funnel. Hocking refrigerators, drums, IPAs, even a book shelf on Twitter. And what then? His head didn&#39;t really move all that much. No speaking tour beckoned. No leis. And what could he talk about for an hour fifteen, other than it&#39;s best when you don&#39;t let an actual bobble head run the country.</p><p>So you could say that whoever cleaved him in three did him a solid. Saved him from an uncertain irrelevance. More dust. Another talkative Hall of Famer. That&#39;s part of the truth. And yet, in any thick tragedy, they kill the clowns first. Hard to believe you&#39;ve got the full weight of history behind you when there&#39;s a bouncing grin and a ludicrously large surfboard lurking behind the teleprompter.</p>
