<p class="name">A Walk</p>
<p>Far down the list of actual problems, if one can even partially order those, is what to listen to. When you&#39;re up in the mountains and only have five and a half FM stations it&#39;s not that hard. When you have millions of playlists it&#39;s harder, especially under time pressure (the start of a short drive, walking just under a mile). I want to pretend for a few paragraphs that this is important and pick apart the mental friction that arises when you have a vague notion of what you want to hear.</p><p>Friday morning I wanted some background music for coding. Except it couldn&#39;t be what I listened to yesterday afternoon (<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/5OA3GuKK5N3c9jMEhV4Kfi">Mountains&#39;s <em>Centralia</em></a>). Or drone in general. Nothing too quiet. Or apocalyptic. Or crescendoing. I could click on &#39;Focus&#39; but there&#39;s no way I trust <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/2ujjMpFriZ2nayLmrD1Jgl">other people to focus</a> the same way I do. Nothing too robotic. Nothing from the future. Not guitar-heavy.</p><p>I ended up listening to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/1t1jtvKSLX3jHMtZqiwaMn">Lush Vibes</a> because I know, trust, and love the people who make it. And I had listened to it for a few minutes the day before and knew it wasn&#39;t going to attack me. It was perfect. If I hadn&#39;t already known about the playlist though I would&#39;ve been stuck, with no real way to get from my sense of what I want to hear to actual music. When I give up I listen to something I&#39;ve heard recently or something in my heavy rotation. Or just take off my headphones and take a walk.</p><p>Most people don&#39;t have as much of an incentive to use Spotify as I do, so they must give up sooner, probably by closing the app, probably for good.</p><p>What I want to do is to take my checklist from above and turn it into a walk through the space of music-that&#39;s-probably-good-by-me. It&#39;s tempting to pull out all the data we have and try to find a path from, say, my cluster of drone artists to <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify/playlist/1t1jtvKSLX3jHMtZqiwaMn">Lush Vibes</a>. Even if we can cover all cases, though, how do you show someone the graph from their heavy rotation to everything just outside it? We&#39;ve got to give them a fast way to get to where they don&#39;t even know they want to go.</p><p>The idea I&#39;ve been stuck on for some time is a screen that has four playlists. You press play on one of the playlists. After you&#39;re well into it the other playlists on the screen fade to different playlists that are close to the one you&#39;re listening to. If you stop playing the playlist right away or otherwise give it the thumbs down it fades and is replaced by something obviously different.</p><p>The real question is whether turning a subconscious checklist into button presses is worth it. The advantage is that people progress through the music by actually listening to it instead of reading/guessing about it. It takes away the part where you translate between a title, an image, and a two-sentence description to a song. The disadvantage is that it&#39;s probably not something you&#39;re going to do when you&#39;re focused on something else. </p>
