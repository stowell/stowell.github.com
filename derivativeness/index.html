<p class="name">Dual review: <em>Below Empty &amp; Westward Bound</em>, <em>Beauty is a Wound</em></p>
<p>Consider this your (perpetual) annual reminder to forgive and accept derivativeness in all its forms, which is really to accept that a lot of people have lived before you and are living right now and most likely thinking thoughts. This reminder comes in the guise of a combined album/book review of <em>Below Empty &amp; Westward Bound</em> from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dartsmusic/">Darts</a> and <em><a href="http://ekakurniawan.com/books/beauty-is-a-wound">Beauty is a Wound</a></em> from Eka Kurniawan.</p><p>To start at the surface, <em>Below Empty &amp; Westward Bound</em> is a straight-up Western tragedy as told by pre-we&#39;ll-all-float-on-okay Modest Mouse. More precisely, imagine <em><a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4011/4285313680_458268ca48.jpg">The Moon &amp; Antarctica</a></em> were one-third as sad, four times as desperate, and was recorded in a single afternoon after one or more of the Modest Mouse people had killed a man to defend the honor of their fellow woman/horse/man. Certainly the only way to spend that time other than splitting up and sprinting from the law is to write down how you&#39;ll split up and sprint from the law or leave behind all the aspects of your life slash eat cold bags of half-eaten fast food just beyond the edge of the highway.</p><p>In the lexicon of a real review, this album is over-constrained and hyper-prioritized. Whatever. Eat a bag. I have listened to it straight through probably 23 times. We can probably derive some useful universal axioms from the existence of Darts.</p><ol><li>Be from Australia.</li><li>Keep your lead singer underfed and caged for at least six hours of the day, preferably the hours leading up to the show.</li><li>Have more than one singer.</li><li>Play guitars.</li><li>Steal from other albums/genres with impunity because a good full album is worth more than originality in this world. Don&#39;t hover yer finger too close to the word &#39;originality&#39; or you will &#39;like&#39; this &#39;thoughtpiece&#39; on at least seven different VC-funded linkfarms and found another.</li></ol><p>There are no such axioms that fall out of <em>Beauty is a Wound</em> even if you shake it really hard. The book is about about the mythical village/town/grouping of Halimunda in what we now call Indonesia. It is of course rife with colonialism and other topics I cannot mention. If you have read <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em> you will recognize much, most especially the flagrant casualness of the most improbable parts of the plot. Some of the parallels are too striking, Colonel Aureliano Buendia reincarnated as the communist Kliwon, Remedios the Beauty returned as Rengganis the Beauty, stayed executions at dawn, the simultaneous killing of dozens of people (the Aurelianos, Maman Gendeng&#39;s thugs) and thousands (the banana factory workers, the communists). That&#39;s just off the top of my head. I could go on. You are looking at your phone.</p><p>The parallels both drew me in with anticipation and repelled me. On a scale of one to five I would give it three stars in order to avoid making any decisions about the nature of quality or how any of us spend our time. Once you pull that thread, where will it end? If an album that slots in pre-existing forms is so good, how could a book that is immediately recognizable be anything but good as well? Will you have to go back to everything Márquez read to prove his originality? And, finding it imperfect, what will you do then? Retract his sainthood? Of course, the optimal course is to read as much as you can or at least purport to, then to not admit enjoying any single thing another human has heard of. At the very least, avoid doing the one thing that every person on this planet was born to do: put <em>Jack &amp; Diane</em> on the jukebox and pound High Lifes and lose at pool.</p>
