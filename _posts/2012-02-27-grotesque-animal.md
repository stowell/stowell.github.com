### _The Past is a Grotesque Animal_ from Of Montreal

**Stayed in the shower too, too long listening to this. (Multiple times in the same day.)**

There's no greater reminder that your tastes are hackable than listening to the same chords and drums and dude singing 'ooooooo ooooooo' for twelve minutes. Humans or any of the species that immediately preceded humans dig and have always dug this rhythm and so in that sense it's timeless.

The lyrics are nonsensical and autobiographical enough to reassure everyone listening at home that they too could write an indie 'rock' 'song' given the time and the inclination. This dude 'fell in love with the first cute girl that [he] met,' like all dudes, and so in that sense this story is timeless. The high point comes for me eight or fourteen minutes in when he declares 'we're always touching my underground wires' which is undoubtedly true and reassuring, knowing that you or I are not the only ones who talk to ourselves too loudly on the sidewalk. (No I am not on my mobile, my phone still has a goddamn antenna I have to extend every call.)

Whatever. I've spent several hours of this weekend doing nothing but tapping out this same beat. When you start releasing the dopamine, just jam right down on it and keep jamming down, hold the button until the machine starts shaking and the smoke turns black.
