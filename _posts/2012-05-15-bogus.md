### _Bogus_ from Whirr

**Took the whole album in over a rainy day, felt better for it, hear this song in my head as time slows down.**

Bogus wastes no time, one and a half seconds of rumbling we're in, the too-far away singing tight with the guitar(s), not even thirty seconds and her voice climbs slightly higher, plaintive maybe, if the whole band weren't red-shifting in place. Less distorted Whirr would have slid comfortably into the nineties, there's even a guitar 'solo' leading right into the shallow waves of voices. Then the denouement ripples, and you realize it's the closing of the trilogy, that the first three songs on Pipe Dreams are in fact one song, Reverse is the buildup, Junebouvier is the action, Bogus the climax and the outtakes. There are no montages; there is no plot.
