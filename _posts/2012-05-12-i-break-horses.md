## _Winter Beats_ and _Hearts_ from I Break Horses

**Where I go to escape in daylight, on repeat in the dark at night, everyone can see your face in the glow of the screen.**

You must listen to Winter Beats and Hearts all at once, they are the same song, they blend right into each other and are obvious opposites, the first telling you 'don't let the cold blood freeze' and in the second you are inside the body, inside of her as she breathes, that is her that you hear as she carries you inside of her.

The thread is the scale running right through Winter Beats into the first 0:15 of Hearts. Her voice is the slide guitar for the first track, you can't tell when she's singing or when it's playing, it is incidental, an implementation detail. You cannot discern a time signature, one, one two, far apart, until 2:35 when every cuckoo clock transforms into a drum machine. You can't understand a thing, 'winter beats', 'cold blood freeze', 'frozen love', an imploring but also something already faded, dead car by the side of the road in Arizona, but Arizona is just outside Helsinki.

Hearts is the more patient and more rewarding half, no singing for a full 1:55, the keyboard lays right over the pulse, you can tell its a pulse because you pick up the beats right away and they are not monotonous, there is that stutter-step.

The scale's turning in the background for 0:35 before you hear the Casio come in (four notes). 'Heartbeats' and percussion start at 0:59, the lightest, the same pulse we hear later, we do not know it yet, and then the snares one, one two, one, full measures apart. The full production hits at 2:35, mirror vocals in the background, the snares kicked up, the slide guitar Baltic siren, rounding the Danish isles, onward to Tallinn. Her voice leaves us completely at 3:24, and we drift through the synths.
