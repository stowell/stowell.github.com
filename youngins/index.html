Caught these two taking turns with the crinkly caterpillar book just after I came home from work. At points in the minutes afterward they each had their hands on it (though Kyle really snatched it to start). They both think that if they lie on their bellies, raise all their limbs, and kick, they will be blessed with movement. Tasman really wants to crawl, you can tell.

Something must be happening off-camera, either my grandfather setting up the tripod or a large bat that has just made itself known in the house. Besseggen is peering close into the camera, covering up her brother behind her. Tonight we read A Trip Through the Human Body, which she enjoys and recalls more and more of. Ezra pulled the wagon on our after-dinner walk. Tasman laughed after he went down a baby slide at the park. Kyle smiled at me when he (well, he and Tasman and Caroline) met me for coffee.

Bess, looking out of a steam train on its way down from Silver Plume. She could take in both the view and the way the train was moving (especially on the uphill return, when it strained and we could see sparks under the belly of the engine). I can explain that the burning coal heats up the water and that the pressure of the steam drives pistons, but I would not be able to draw or build an engine of any sort. A fear for the day when we wake up and all our technology has disappeared. In another generation, how far will children's stories (about steam engines or passenger ships) diverge from the present? Not that, on a perfectly clear, dry day in the Rockies, that's anything to worry about.

This is the first time I've seen Ezra contemplate climbing these ropes, let alone touch them. A rare clear difference between days. Tonight he was saying 'I will lie down and close my eyes in a few minutes. I will go to sleep in a few minutes. You will go downstairs in a few minutes.' The sentences are complete, but not that much different from how he's talked for the last few months. Yet the conversation felt different from earlier. He tied together a sequence of events. And his estimate of 'a few minutes' turned out to be accurate, though he has no idea what a minute is.
