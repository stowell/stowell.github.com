<p>is the essential human activity.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What do you do here?<br>
I am the custodian. The caretaker.<br>
What do you take care of?<br>
The church.<br>
It done fell down.  </p></blockquote>
<p>I wanted to re-read <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=B96JDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;ots=pYJ3h0V5_n&amp;dq=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;f=false)">The Crossing</a></em> for the beard-munching monologues the boy hears from people somehow surviving all alone in northern Mexico. The diversions in the back half of <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AI75CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT171&amp;ots=Ogwn6YY5la&amp;dq=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it&#x27;s%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;pg=PT171#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it&#x27;s%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;f=false">The Last Samurai</a></em> reminded me that if a story-within-a-story is just outlandish enough you won&#39;t roll your eyes (the HC/RD backstory being my favorite). <em>The Crossing</em> is of course deeply sad, it batters you more so when you know what&#39;s going to happen. I&#39;ve been laughing a lot, though, mostly when anyone speaks.</p>
