<h2>Revisiting what you already thought you knew is the essential human activity</h2>

<p>What do you do here?<br>
I am the custodian. The caretaker.<br>
What do you take care of?<br>
The church.<br>
It done fell down.  </p></blockquote>
<p>I wanted to re-read <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=B96JDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;ots=pYJ3h0V5_n&amp;dq=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;f=false)">The Crossing</a></em> for the beard-munching monologues the boy hears from people somehow surviving all alone in northern Mexico. The diversions in the back half of <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AI75CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT171&amp;ots=Ogwn6YY5la&amp;dq=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it's%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;pg=PT171#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it's%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;f=false">The Last Samurai</a></em> reminded me that if a story-within-a-story is just outlandish enough you won't roll your eyes (the HC/RD backstory being my favorite). <em>The Crossing</em> is of course deeply sad, it batters you more so when you know what's going to happen. I've been laughing a lot, though, mostly when anyone speaks.</p><p>I just started listening deliberately to late nineties indie rock thanks to an album from Brian, a playlist from Bo, and nine albums and some rambling from Brendan. Whenever people ask me what I listen to I laugh to delay answering and if the person is still there when I'm done laughing I say late nineties indie rock which is so broad a category no one can think I'm stupid for not having heard so-and-so. But I know that I've barely heard any of it, it's just the period of time immediately preceding the formative period of 2000-2004 for me.</p><p>What's the verdict so far? Pinback's Tripoli is pretty perfect, I can't put my finger on it, muted but not too quiet, downcast but not overtly sad. The Archers of Loaf hit a little harder, they're on the outside of what I'd listen to repeatedly. Both these YouTube finds (hanks Bo) are above-solid and maybe non-existent in the material world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKkQ67Gsock">Philistine</a> and [Virginia Fur][Virginia Fur].</p><p>I don't even really know why I'm doing this other than I'm a little burnt on listening to new music and it's great to have an excuse to get recommendations from people from one of their favorite periods of time and maybe just maybe when someone asks me what music I like I can name three albums without laughing beforehand.</p><p>Actually, I take that back. It's to chart the territory between Deeper Into Movies, He's Simple, He's Dumb, He's the Pilot, Randy Described Eternity, and Two Headed Boy. There was a time before all these songs and parts of them had probably been lying around for a while and I'd like to hear that.</p>
