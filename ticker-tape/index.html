  <p>Nowadays, people tell many a tall tale of unbowed resistance fighters, whether passive or active, but the truth is that most real-life resistance fighters&mdash;of whom there were few and all of them short-lived&mdash; were shot or imprisoned during the years after the War or else went into exile or were purged and suffered reprisals and were prevented from freely exercising their professions . . .</p></blockquote>
  <p>At first I didn&#39;t know what to make of this monologue, so overtly explaining The One Myth that also sustained <em>Your Face Tomorrow</em>, at least part of it, blending of course with The One True Myth of the Anglo-Saxon world, which is the second world war. The protagonist&#39;s father says something to the effect that you think you have time to hold onto anger, that you will live forever. This slinking away he captures very well over and over again, times no one would want to remember and they try to bury out of shame and most often succeed, to themselves. All of this is clear from reading without it being spelled out for you, so I didn&#39;t know what to say in this case but on a second reading it stands up, he is not taking a new stance or a bolder one, he is making it clear exactly what happened.</p><p>How eager we are to feel outrage or superiority, yet the people who lived through an actual calamity buried it as quickly as they could and even the victors did not know what to do with themselves after a time.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>In the long run, there&#39;s little to be gained by imposing your story on other people, it&#39;s almost like telling a story to yourself, which is no fun at all: if your views are only ever endorsed by your co-religionists or by mere acolytes and fearful servants, it&#39;s a bit like playing yourself at chess.</p></blockquote>

  <p>Opening Connect4 yesterday, watching the kids press buttons to change the patterns on a giant screen at the Museum of Science, and learning Sorry! with Bess this afternoon awakened that yearning to just write small programs and to write them with Bess. Which of course circles back to making something straightforward enough to teach to five year olds. I don&#39;t feel cut out for that. It would be highly visual. I often feel like a luddite, someone who would prefer to type or write than pinch and zoom my way to a game. Visual languages seem like translations of a few language constructs into two dimensions. What I want is something you can be sloppy in and refine, that&#39;s available <em>absolutely everywhere</em>.</p><p>What if you steal Eve&#39;s data model (or my guess as to what Eve&#39;s model is from reading the beginning of the tutorial): records are named sets of key-value pairs. How do you represent a board? I think this is the case where you want a lot of vocabulary already in the language, you have a grid and a way to manipulate the grid. It&#39;s okay if it starts out textual. You want it to be quick to get to an eager player and try it out.</p><p>(I just went down the rabbit hole of trying to distill the Eve core language and it&#39;s a little more involved than I had thought. I don&#39;t want to get hung up on it. Steal the gist and start writing things to SimpleDB or somesuch thing.)</p><p>Reading the very beginning of <em>Europe 1815-1914: The Pursuit of Power</em> or some amalgamation of those words. It mentions the improved bureaucracy that Napoleon planted in the German lands he conquered and I wanted to put the book down right there and dive deeper, not because bureaucracy is so hot but because there&#39;s probably something real there, or at least a list of dumb things that people stopped doing. You can steal ideas from a book like that, in fact that&#39;s a good measure of what&#39;s worthwhile to read and why a lot of what I read feels so empty, there&#39;s nothing to steal from the life of a Russian czar.</p>

  <p>Some work-related ideas that floated through my head this morning when I was feeling optimistic, say nine ten a.m.: a service that stores what you&#39;ve listened to in the past 24 hours, a service that stores what we&#39;ve recommended to you in the past 24 hours (a question: what&#39;s our click-through rate for any recommendations on Home? Does it improve if things are fresh or does that not really matter at all because no one&#39;s going to listen to <em>Epic Wall of Sound</em>?), trying to correlate startup time to listening time, trying to sort by distance in genre-space instead of vectors.</p><p>If I can keep us doing dumb (simple) things first I&#39;ll be happy. That&#39;s my one goal this year and I guess has been implicitly my goal all along.</p><p>I just installed <code>fswatch</code> in the hope that I can run <code>fswatch path/to/single/java/file | xargs mvn test</code> and run tests every time that file changes and edit it in Atom and not worry about an IDE but still be writing Java, becoming as conversant in it as Python and getting over my loathing for the whole ecosystem.</p>

  <p>What has been dragging me down about grinding out clusters is making mistakes I&#39;ve already made or could have easily prevented. It&#39;s really dumb and we should put this thing to bed now that we&#39;ve launched a test. It&#39;s about having already done your chores.</p><p>The voices that nag at you and tell you you should really do something, you should listen to them, it must be one of those things you can identify more easily as you get older.</p>

  RD said: It&#39;s not the same.
  They played until 2:00 in the morning. RD kept saying It&#39;s not the same, but he was laughing now because he was winning most of the time.</p></blockquote>
  <p>This is still my favorite aside in <em>The Last Samurai</em>, especially so because it runs long and you do not realize at first why are you reading it. I read for that feeling of not knowing, to piece together what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s the same way watching movies with the sound off. You have to think.</p><p>Anyway I can picture these boys. The asides in <em>The Crossing</em> are much more serious, as if Billy encounters the same oracle over and over with a different guise. What the people say seems possible but not how long they go on and the consistent focus on their themes. It&#39;s not clear what will happen in any of them but they are much more sober.</p><p>I can&#39;t even cut out a slice of Billy talking to the gypsy hauling a biplane, here&#39;s the closest, a few pages from the end of the book:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Billy said that it seemed to him that the freighters did not hold the identity of the airplane to be of any great consequence but the gitano only turned and studied him with those dark and troubled eyes. He said that it was indeed of consequence and that it was in fact the whole burden of their inquiry. From a certain perspective one might even hazard to say that the great trouble with the world was that which survived was held in hard evidence as to past events. A false authority clung to what persisted...</p></blockquote>
  <p>There is a whimsical humor hanging over HC and RD, RD in particular, but the whimsy drops right out of every book in The Border Trilogy. There comes the hardest moment and after that people speak in biting words but never wry words.</p>
  <h2 id="does-anyone-remember-laughter-or-good-old-american-whiskey">Does anyone remember laughter or good old american whiskey</h2>
  <p>As soon as Boyd gets shot all humor drops out of the book. Maybe a biting comment from a recruiting officer or a waitress. The story of the blind man stands out, at least him trying to drown himself in a river that&#39;s too shallow. I can&#39;t remember if there&#39;s one more side story left. There is the drunk man who has three bullet holes in his chest but he has no captivating story just the bullet holes and the mescal. The Mexican Revolution hangs over this book and <em>All the Pretty Horses</em>, it&#39;s the generation after the revolution, the land is heavy with it.</p><p><a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2016/12/tim-duy-desperately-searching-new-strategy.html">Tyler Cowen</a> asks what would happen if 70 percent of the country gave up alcohol and drugs voluntarily. It&#39;s hard to argue against trying this unilaterally. It would take a lot for me to swallow the persona I put on at work and probably annoying at first for people around me but then Rajiv has been straight sober for years and it hasn&#39;t hurt him.</p><p>It&#39;s also hard to argue against just getting something in a Slack bot instead of wondering which ideas to copy from Eve. Anything you have to check on, like running a job or copying data to BigQuery, would be great to get in. Instead of watching spinners you could receive a poke.</p>
  <h2 id="you-probably-keep-thinking-the-same-thoughts-over-and-over-because-you-haven&#39;t-done-anything-about-them">You probably keep thinking the same thoughts over and over because you haven&#39;t done anything about them</h2>
  <p>What&#39;s lurking behind our new query-by-description stack and the NFT stack is wanting to quickly and on the fly find a set of tracks, determine if it&#39;s any good (is it coherent? is it close to what the listener wants?), and sort/shuffle them. That&#39;s it.</p><p>The interesting part that we haven&#39;t really tackled head-on is &#39;are these tracks any good together?&#39;</p><p>There&#39;s a way you think when you know what you have to do and you break it down and start to do it and there&#39;s another way entirely when you catch hold of an idea not sure if it&#39;s worth it or not but can only find out by trying. You can only operate one way at a time. For me it&#39;s impossible to catch hold of any idea if I&#39;m looking for it but I can forget to keep a lookout when I&#39;m doing what I know I should be doing.</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>The thin horned moon lay on its back in the west like a grail and the bright shape of Venus hung directly above it like a star falling into a boat. They kept to the open country clear of the river and they rode all night and toward the morning they made a dry camp in a quemada of burned trees clustered dead and black and ragged on a slight rise a mile west of the river.</p></blockquote>
  <p>My question reading most McCarthy but especially this trilogy is how deeply he imagines the landscape. How much of that part of the southwest U.S. and northern Mexico do you have to see before you can imagine all of it? Does he go with his characters or does he imagine just beyond where they currently are?</p><p>In the majority of fiction I read I can see the mechanism at work, what the author thought of first and where there mind went after that. Reading <em>The Crossing</em> I see the same tricks played repeatedly, imagining the landscape or animals having been put in place by a god or gods who don&#39;t quite know what they&#39;re doing. But I can&#39;t pick apart where the plot starts in his mind and that&#39;s why I can stand to read it again.</p>
  <h2 id="opposite-every-rant-there&#39;s-an-anti-rant-awaiting-extraction">Opposite every rant there&#39;s an anti-rant awaiting extraction</h2>
  <p>Amen to <a href="http://tinyclouds.org/rant.html">Ryan Dahl</a>, who among us can&#39;t get behind simplicity and in particular simplicity that we once had in our hands in the seventies but let slip away: &#39;In the past year I think I have finally come to understand the ideals of Unix: file descriptors and processes orchestrated with C. It&#39;s a beautiful idea.&#39;</p><p>The title of the piece is <em>I hate almost all software</em> which is fine, I get it, most every simple thing is too fraught and our field tends to select for people who have the patience enough to outlast the minutaue of getting an actual program to run on real computers most of the time. But everything is awful and the man himself has spent a good chunk of his time writing software. Let&#39;s see if we can&#39;t turn this anger inside out:</p>
  <blockquote>
  <p>Those of you who still find it enjoyable to learn the details of, say, a programming language - being able to happily recite off if NaN equals or does not equal null - you just don&#39;t yet understand how utterly fucked the whole thing is. If you think it would be cute to align all of the equals signs in your code, if you spend time configuring your window manager or editor, if put unicode check marks in your test runner, if you add unnecessary hierarchies in your code directories, if you are doing anything beyond just solving the problem...</p></blockquote>

  <blockquote>
  <p>There&#39;s a mule&#39;s died, Boyd said.<br>
  How do you know?<br>
  There just has.<br>
  Billy looked over the camp. There were no animals of any description about.<br>
  Likely the mules is hobbled up in them oaks yonder, he said.<br>
  No they aint.<br>
  When the girl came back she said that one of the mules had died.<br>
  Shit, said Billy.</p></blockquote>
  <p>My favorite stretch of a book is when you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going to happen. If you&#39;re going to read a book again you have to wait long enough for the details to fade from your mind. The arc can stay. It&#39;s why I loved <em>The Last Samurai</em> until it became clear that Ludo was just going to keep trying to claim a father. The back stories for the potential fathers became a respite from a pattern.</p>
  <h2 id="how-else-does-anything-happen-other-than-the-continual-shameless-stealing-of-ideas">How else does anything happen other than the continual shameless stealing of ideas</h2>
  <p>There&#39;s a lot in <a href="http://play.witheve.com/#/examples/quickstart.eve">Eve</a>, both in spirit and implementation, that&#39;s worth stealing or at least spreading as far and wide as possible so that it&#39;s not lost: the program can never blow up, only produce error records, everything is data manipulation, the program and the database are the same thing and move through time together, code is a part of prose, code executes when there&#39;s something to execute on.</p><p>An off-hand Chris Granger tweet mentioned that Slack messages are valid Eve programs and I wonder just how far they&#39;ve taken that. The fact that there are braces and pound signs in the language makes me think that no one&#39;s written large programs in Eve on their phones. That&#39;s exactly where I want to go with these ideas and if we have to toss some punctuation to get there well.</p><p>When my mind starts going down this path I worry that I&#39;m stuck in the same rut I&#39;ve been stuck in since I was nineteen, wanting to write a programming language because the people who had written programming languages seemed super-smart. Nowadays I&#39;m not so scared of ruts. Just last week we were talking about making a track-to-track recommender for a prototype and it&#39;s the same story for the thirty-first time: pull back a set of plausible recommendations, take the subset that actually makes sense together, return it in some order. The rules around ordering change but are always similar and obvious to the listener when you get them wrong. The younger me would say we&#39;ve written this program too many times but now I&#39;d day we&#39;ve just got to get better at writing it.</p>

  <p>I wanted to re-read <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=B96JDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;ots=pYJ3h0V5_n&amp;dq=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;f=false)">The Crossing</a></em> for the beard-munching monologues the boy hears from people somehow surviving all alone in northern Mexico. The diversions in the back half of <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AI75CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT171&amp;ots=Ogwn6YY5la&amp;dq=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it&#x27;s%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;pg=PT171#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it&#x27;s%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;f=false">The Last Samurai</a></em> reminded me that if a story-within-a-story is just outlandish enough you won&#39;t roll your eyes (the HC/RD backstory being my favorite). <em>The Crossing</em> is of course deeply sad, it batters you more so when you know what&#39;s going to happen. I&#39;ve been laughing a lot, though, mostly when anyone speaks.</p><p>I just started listening deliberately to late nineties indie rock thanks to an album from Brian, a playlist from Bo, and nine albums and some rambling from Brendan. Whenever people ask me what I listen to I laugh to delay answering and if the person is still there when I&#39;m done laughing I say late nineties indie rock which is so broad a category no one can think I&#39;m stupid for not having heard so-and-so. But I know that I&#39;ve barely heard any of it, it&#39;s just the period of time immediately preceding the formative period of 2000-2004 for me.</p><p>What&#39;s the verdict so far? Pinback&#39;s Tripoli is pretty perfect, I can&#39;t put my finger on it, muted but not too quiet, downcast but not overtly sad. The Archers of Loaf hit a little harder, they&#39;re on the outside of what I&#39;d listen to repeatedly. Both these YouTube finds (hanks Bo) are above-solid and maybe non-existent in the material world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKkQ67Gsock">Philistine</a> and [Virginia Fur][Virginia Fur].</p><p>I don&#39;t even really know why I&#39;m doing this other than I&#39;m a little burnt on listening to new music and it&#39;s great to have an excuse to get recommendations from people from one of their favorite periods of time and maybe just maybe when someone asks me what music I like I can name three albums without laughing beforehand.</p><p>Actually, I take that back. It&#39;s to chart the territory between Deeper Into Movies, He&#39;s Simple, He&#39;s Dumb, He&#39;s the Pilot, Randy Described Eternity, and Two Headed Boy. There was a time before all these songs and parts of them had probably been lying around for a while and I&#39;d like to hear that.</p>
