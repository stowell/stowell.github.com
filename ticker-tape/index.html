<p>is the essential human activity.</p>

<p>What do you do here?<br>
I am the custodian. The caretaker.<br>
What do you take care of?<br>
The church.<br>
It done fell down.  </p></blockquote>
<p>I wanted to re-read <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=B96JDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;ots=pYJ3h0V5_n&amp;dq=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;f=false)">The Crossing</a></em> for the beard-munching monologues the boy hears from people somehow surviving all alone in northern Mexico. The diversions in the back half of <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AI75CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT171&amp;ots=Ogwn6YY5la&amp;dq=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it&#x27;s%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;pg=PT171#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it&#x27;s%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;f=false">The Last Samurai</a></em> reminded me that if a story-within-a-story is just outlandish enough you won&#39;t roll your eyes (the HC/RD backstory being my favorite). <em>The Crossing</em> is of course deeply sad, it batters you more so when you know what&#39;s going to happen. I&#39;ve been laughing a lot, though, mostly when anyone speaks.</p><p>I just started listening deliberately to late nineties indie rock thanks to an album from Brian, a playlist from Bo, and nine albums and some rambling from Brendan. Whenever people ask me what I listen to I laugh to delay answering and if the person is still there when I&#39;m done laughing I say late nineties indie rock which is so broad a category no one can think I&#39;m stupid for not having heard so-and-so. But I know that I&#39;ve barely heard any of it, it&#39;s just the period of time immediately preceding the formative period of 2000-2004 for me.</p><p>What&#39;s the verdict so far? Pinback&#39;s Tripoli is pretty perfect, I can&#39;t put my finger on it, muted but not too quiet, downcast but not overtly sad. The Archers of Loaf hit a little harder, they&#39;re on the outside of what I&#39;d listen to repeatedly. Both these YouTube finds (hanks Bo) are above-solid and maybe non-existent in the material world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKkQ67Gsock">Philistine</a> and [Virginia Fur][Virginia Fur].</p><p>I don&#39;t even really know why I&#39;m doing this other than I&#39;m a little burnt on listening to new music and it&#39;s great to have an excuse to get recommendations from people from one of their favorite periods of time and maybe just maybe when someone asks me what music I like I can name three albums without laughing beforehand.</p>
