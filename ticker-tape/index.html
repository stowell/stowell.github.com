  <h2 id="how-else-does-anything-happen-other-than-the-continual-shameless-stealing-of-ideas">How else does anything happen other than the continual shameless stealing of ideas</h2>
  <p>There&#39;s a lot in <a href="http://play.witheve.com/#/examples/quickstart.eve">Eve</a>, both in spirit and implementation, that&#39;s worth stealing or at least spreading as far and wide as possible so that it&#39;s not lost: the program can never blow up, only produce error records, everything is data manipulation, the program and the database are the same thing and move through time together, code is a part of prose, code executes when there&#39;s something to execute on.</p><p>An off-hand Chris Granger tweet mentioned that Slack messages are valid Eve programs and I wonder just how far they&#39;ve taken that. The fact that there are braces and pound signs in the language makes me think that no one&#39;s written large programs in Eve on their phones. That&#39;s exactly where I want to go with these ideas and if we have to toss some punctuation to get there well.</p><p>When my mind starts going down this path I worry that I&#39;m stuck in the same rut I&#39;ve been stuck in since I was nineteen, wanting to write a programming language because the people who had written programming languages seemed super-smart. Nowadays I&#39;m not so scared of ruts. Just last week we were talking about making a track-to-track recommender for a prototype and it&#39;s the same story for the thirty-first time: pull back a set of plausible recommendations, take the subset that actually makes sense together, return it in some order. The rules around ordering change but are always similar and obvious to the listener when you get them wrong. The younger me would say we&#39;ve written this program too many times but now I&#39;d day we&#39;ve just got to get better at writing it.</p>

  <p>I wanted to re-read <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=B96JDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA140&amp;ots=pYJ3h0V5_n&amp;dq=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;pg=PA140#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20crossing%20%22it%20done%20fell%20down%22&amp;f=false)">The Crossing</a></em> for the beard-munching monologues the boy hears from people somehow surviving all alone in northern Mexico. The diversions in the back half of <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=AI75CwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT171&amp;ots=Ogwn6YY5la&amp;dq=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it&#x27;s%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;pg=PT171#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20last%20samurai%20%22it&#x27;s%20not%20the%20same%22&amp;f=false">The Last Samurai</a></em> reminded me that if a story-within-a-story is just outlandish enough you won&#39;t roll your eyes (the HC/RD backstory being my favorite). <em>The Crossing</em> is of course deeply sad, it batters you more so when you know what&#39;s going to happen. I&#39;ve been laughing a lot, though, mostly when anyone speaks.</p><p>I just started listening deliberately to late nineties indie rock thanks to an album from Brian, a playlist from Bo, and nine albums and some rambling from Brendan. Whenever people ask me what I listen to I laugh to delay answering and if the person is still there when I&#39;m done laughing I say late nineties indie rock which is so broad a category no one can think I&#39;m stupid for not having heard so-and-so. But I know that I&#39;ve barely heard any of it, it&#39;s just the period of time immediately preceding the formative period of 2000-2004 for me.</p><p>What&#39;s the verdict so far? Pinback&#39;s Tripoli is pretty perfect, I can&#39;t put my finger on it, muted but not too quiet, downcast but not overtly sad. The Archers of Loaf hit a little harder, they&#39;re on the outside of what I&#39;d listen to repeatedly. Both these YouTube finds (hanks Bo) are above-solid and maybe non-existent in the material world: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tKkQ67Gsock">Philistine</a> and [Virginia Fur][Virginia Fur].</p><p>I don&#39;t even really know why I&#39;m doing this other than I&#39;m a little burnt on listening to new music and it&#39;s great to have an excuse to get recommendations from people from one of their favorite periods of time and maybe just maybe when someone asks me what music I like I can name three albums without laughing beforehand.</p><p>Actually, I take that back. It&#39;s to chart the territory between Deeper Into Movies, He&#39;s Simple, He&#39;s Dumb, He&#39;s the Pilot, Randy Described Eternity, and Two Headed Boy. There was a time before all these songs and parts of them had probably been lying around for a while and I&#39;d like to hear that.</p>
